# review

Dec 15th, 2022

I took a break after finishing the bootcamp on Augsut,2022. I started reviewing the bootcamp content starting on Dec 7th,2022. The U of T bootcamp
was challenging not to say the least and eventhough I completed it succesfully with a grade of around (84%) I still feel like I did understnad all the
materials in full depth.

I drew out a plan to start reviewing the whole material from A-Z solving the 01-Activities, Mini projects, Challenges and Projects. I plan to finish reviewing the materials
at around March 2nd, 2023. 

I will be pushing the code at least once a day to keep a record of my work. Akthough, I will refrence the Solved folders if I felt stuck, I will try my best to complete everything 
replying on my own knowledge or online resources if possible. 

I am confindent that by March 2nd, 2022 I will be confident in my skills as a Web Developer and I will start learning UX/UI and other coding languages such as 
PHP, C++ and C#, Phython, Java and study data structures and algorithims.
